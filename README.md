### Introduction and problem attempted to solve
According to the WHO, <br>
*__`Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty or the unknown. So it is normal and understandable that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical, health.` <br>__*

It is essential to ensure that we analyze our thought patterns, understand ourselves, and finally have some time to play<br>
and a dose of daily inspiration to keep us going.<br>

The desire to achieve this led to the 
development of Mental-Aid: A web application to help people with special mental needs
